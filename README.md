# Quick_Pet1 - No Comercial - Student Purposes only-
I have designed an application called Quick Pet, a user-friendly app for pet 
owners to keep track of their pet’s information. For the design of my application, I have 
used AdobeXD and for the development of Android Studio, which I found to be very 
easy to use and efficient in creating the design that I intended for my application. I 
successfully began the process of creating an interactive application using Android 
Studio. What drew me to using Android Studio was its Gradle-base system which is 
flexible, a fast emulator feature, and its integration with GitHub, making it easy to import 
codes and keep track of changes.
After carrying out the appropriate surveys and various testing, I was able to decide how 
I wanted my application to look – and as my prototype and final demonstration, I was 
successfully able to execute this using Android Studio.
Furthermore, I used Firebase, which I believe to be the most suitable database for my 
application. What particularly drew me to this database was that it makes authentication 
easy for both users and developers, meaning that despite its criticisms, I found it reliable 
and secure.
Overall, I am satisfied with the way Quick pet has turned out. It is easy to use and 
navigate, and I have received positive feedback after continuously testing it
